Homeworks from the [CIS194](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html) of the University of Pennsylvania by [Brent Yorgey](http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/).

I began the Spring 2013 version of the course because it was - and still it is, now that I am writing - a recommended reference at the end of the ["Get Started"](https://www.haskell.org/get-started/) section of the official Haskell site; I eventually found out that there is [more recent version](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/fall16/), but I already started with the oldest one, so I sticked with it. In some rare cases, I eventually had to sligthly modify the original files (e.g.: I needed to add the Semigroup and Monoid instances to the GuestList on the Employee.hs file of Homework W8).

I tried to solve by my own all the exercises. Sometimes - maybe because I was stuck, or maybe because I didn't really like the style of my solution - I looked at solutions of other people (many thanks to all of you!):
